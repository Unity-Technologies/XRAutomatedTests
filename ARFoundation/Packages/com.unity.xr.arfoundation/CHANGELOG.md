# Changelog
All notable changes to this package will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/)
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.0.0-preview.22] - 2018-12-13

- Fix package dependency

## [1.0.0-preview.21] - 2018-12-13

### New
- Added Face Tracking support:  `ARFaceManager`, `ARFace`, `ARFaceMeshVisualizer` and related scripts. See documentation for usage. 

### Improvements
- Plane detection modes: Add ability to selectively enable detection for horizontal, vertical, or both types of planes. The `ARPlaneManager` includes a new setting, which defaults to both.
- Add support for setting the camera focus mode. Added a new component, `ARCameraOptions`, which lets you set the focus mode.

### Changes
- The light estimation option, which was previously on the `ARSession` component, has been moved to the new `ARCameraOptions` component.

## [1.0.0-preview.20] - 2018-11-06
### Improvements
- Support reference points reported without a corresponding `TryAddReferencePoint` call. This handles reference points that are added by some other means, e.g., loaded from a serialized session.

## [1.0.0-preview.19] - 2018-10-10
- Added support for `XRCameraExtensions` API to get the raw camera image data on the CPU. See the [manual documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.xr.arfoundation@1.0/manual/cpu-camera-image.html) for more information.

## [1.0.0-preview.18] - 2018-09-13
### Fixes
- The `ARPlaneMeshVisualizer` did not disable its visible components (`MeshRenderer` and `LineRenderer`) when disabled. This has been fixed.

### Changes
- The `ARPlaneManager`, `ARPointCloudManager`, and `ARReferencePointManager` all instantiate either prefabs that you specify or `GameObject`s with at least an `ARPlane`, `ARPointCloud`, or `ARReferencePoint`, respectively, on them. The instantiated `GameObject`'s layer was set to match the `ARSessionOrigin`, overwriting the layer specified in the prefab. This has been changed so that if a prefab is specified, no changes to the layer are made. If no prefab is specified, then a new `GameObject` is created, and its layer will match that of the `ARSessionOrigin`'s `GameObject`.

### New
- Added `ARPlane.normal` to get the `ARPlane`'s normal in world space.

### LWRP support 
Added LWRP support by allowing `ARCameraBackground` to use a background renderer that overrides the default functionality.  This works in conjunction with some *LWRPSupport* files (see [arfoundation-samples](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/arfoundation-samples)) that will live in your LWRP project.  

## [1.0.0-preview.17] - 2018-08-02
### Fixes
- Add `FormerlySerializedAs` attribute to serialized field changes to `ARCameraBackground`.

## [1.0.0-preview.16] - 2018-07-26
### Change
- Removed static constructor from `ARSubsystemManager`. This allows access to the manager without forcing the creation of the subsystems, making the initialization more flexible.

## [1.0.0-preview.15] - 2018-07-26
### Fixes
- `ARPlane.vertexChangedThreshold` is no longer allowed to be negative.
- The `ARCameraBackground` component did not reset the projection matrix on disable, leading to stretching or other distortion. This has been fixed.
- The `ARCameraBackground` component did not properly handle an overriden material. This has been fixed (see API Changes below).
- The `ARPlaneMeshGenerators` was meant to generate a triangle fan about the center of the plane. However, indices were instead generated as a fan about one of the bounary points. The visual result is similar, but can lead to long thin triangles. This has been fixed to use the plane's center point as intended.
- Update for compatibility with 2018.3
- If the `ARPlaneMeshVisualizer` has a `LineRenderer` on it, then it will be scaled to match the `ARPlane`'s scale, making the visual width invariant under differing `ARSessionOrigin` scales.
- When the `ARPointCloudManager` instantiated a point cloud prefab, it did not change its transform. If it was not identity, then feature points would appear in unexpected places. It now instantiates the point cloud prefab with identity transform.
- The menu item "GameObject > XR > AR Default Point Cloud" created a `GameObject` which used a particle system whose "Scaling Mode" was set to "Local". If used as the `ARPointCloudManager`'s point cloud prefab, this would produce odd results when the `ARSessionOrigin` was scaled. The correct setting is "Hierarchy", and the utility now creates a particle system with the correct setting.

### API Changes
#### ARCameraBackground
The API for overriding the material has been refactored. Previously, a custom material could be set with the `ARCameraBackground.material` setter, but this might be overwritten later if the option to override was disabled.
- Rename: `overrideMaterial` is now `useCustomMaterial`
- New member: `customMaterial`
- The following properties are now private:
    - `material` setter (getter is still public)
    - `backgroundRenderer`

Use the `ARCameraBackground.material` getter to get the currently active material.

## [1.0.0-preview.14] - 2018-07-17
### Fixes
- Fixed a bug in the `ARCameraBackground` which would not render the camera texture properly if the `ARSession` had been destroyed and then recreated or if the `ARCameraBackground` had been disabled and then re-enabled.
- `ARSubsystemManager.systemState`'s setter was not private, allowing user code to change the system state. The setter is now private.
- `ARPlane.trackingState` returned a cached value, which was incorrect if the `ARSession` was no longer active.

### Improvements
- Added `ARSession.Reset()` to destroy the current AR Session and establish a new one. This destroys all trackables, such as planes.
- Added an `ARSubsystemManager.sessionDestroyed` event. The `ARPlaneManager`, `ARPointCloudManager`, and `ARReferencePointManager` subscribe to this event, and they remove their trackables when the `ARSession` is destroyed.

## [1.0.0-preview.13] - 2018-07-03
- Fixed a bug where point clouds did not stop rendering when disabled.
- Added a getter on the `ARPointCloudManager` for the instantiated `ARPointCloud`.
- Added UVs to the `Mesh` generated by the `ARPlaneMeshVisualizer`.
- Refactored out plane mesh generation functionality into a new static class `ARPlaneMeshGenerators`.
- Added a `meshUpdated` event to the `ARPlaneMeshVisualizer`, which lets you customize the generated `Mesh`.
- Added AR Icons.

## [1.0.0-preview.12] - 2018-06-14
- Add color correction value to `LightEstimationData`.

## [1.0.0-preview.11] - 2018-06-08
- Improve lifecycle reporting: remove public members `ARSubsystemManager.availability` and `ARSubsystemManager.trackingState`. Combine with `ARSubsystemManager.systemState` and the public event `ARSubsystemManager.systemStateChanged`.
- Docs improvements
- Move `ParticleSystem` to the top of the `ARDebugPointCloudVisualizer`

## [1.0.0-preview.10] - 2018-06-06

- Update documentation: ARSession image and written description.

## [1.0.0-preview.9] - 2018-06-06

- Rename `ARBackgroundRenderer` to `ARCameraBackground`
- Unify `ARSessionState` & `ARSystemState` enums

## [1.0.0-preview.8] - 2018-05-23
- Change dependency to `ARExtension` 1.0.0-preview.2

## [1.0.0-preview.7] - 2018-05-23
- Remove "timeout" from AR Session
- Add availability and AR install support
- Significant rework to startup lifecycle & asynchronous availability check

## [1.0.0-preview.6] - 2018-04-25

### Rename ARUtilities to ARFoundation

- This package is now called `ARFoundation`.
- Removed `ARPlaceOnPlane`, `ARMakeAppearOnPlane`, `ARPlaneMeshVisualizer`, and `ARPointCloudParticleVisualizer` as these were deemed sample content.
- Removed setup wizard.
- Renamed `ARRig` to `ARSessionOrigin`.
- `ARSessionOrigin` no longer requires its `Camera` to be a child of itself.
